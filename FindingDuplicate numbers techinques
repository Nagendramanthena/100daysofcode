//There are n + 1n+1 positive numbers in the array (numsnums) (all in the range [1, n][1,n]). Since the array only contains positive integers, we can track each number (numnum) that has been seen before by flipping the sign of the number located at index |num|∣num∣, where ||∣∣ denotes absolute value.

For example, if the input array is [1, 3, 3, 2][1,3,3,2], then for 11, flip the number at index 11, making the array [1,-3,3,2][1,−3,3,2]. Next, for -3−3 flip the number at index 33, making the array [1,-3,3,-2][1,−3,3,−2]. Finally, when we reach the second 33, we'll notice that nums[3]nums[3] is already negative, indicating that 33 has been seen before and hence is the duplicate number.

Algorithm

Iterate over the array, evaluating each element (let's call the current element curcur).

Since we use negative marking, we must ensure that the current element (curcur) is positive (i.e. if curcur is negative, then use its absolute value).

Check if nums[cur]nums[cur] is negative.

If it is, then we have already performed this operation for the same number, and hence curcur is the duplicate number. Store curcur as the duplicate and exit the loop.

Otherwise, flip the sign of nums[cur]nums[cur] (i.e. make it negative). Move to the next element and repeat step 3.

Once we've identified the duplicate, we could just return the duplicate number. However, even though we were not able to meet the problem constraints, we can show that we are mindful of the constraints by restoring the array. This is done by changing all negative numbers to positive.


class Solution {
    public int findDuplicate(int[] nums) {
        int duplicate = -1;
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
            int cur = Math.abs(nums[i]);
            if (nums[cur] < 0) {
                duplicate = cur;
                break;
            }
            nums[cur] *= -1;
        }
        
        // Restore numbers
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++)
            nums[i] = Math.abs(nums[i]);
            
           
           
 // HashMAp
 class Solution {    
    public int store(int[] nums, int cur) {
        if (cur == nums[cur])
            return cur;
        int nxt = nums[cur];
        nums[cur] = cur;
        return store(nums, nxt);        
    }
    
    public int findDuplicate(int[] nums) {
        return store(nums, 0);
    }
}
